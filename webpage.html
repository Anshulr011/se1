        The <strong>Taj Mahal</strong><em>('Crown of the Palace') </em>  is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, 
        which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
